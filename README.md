## What is reCaptcha?
reCAPTCHA provides advanced protection for your website, preventing fraud and abuse without causing inconvenience. It utilizes an intelligent risk analysis engine and adaptive challenges to deter malicious software and ensure legitimate users can access your site effortlessly. With over a decade of proven success, reCAPTCHA actively safeguards data for millions of websites. Its frictionless approach seamlessly detects and blocks bots and automated attacks while allowing genuine users to proceed. Through continuous machine learning, reCAPTCHA's adaptive algorithms consider customer and bot interactions, surpassing the limitations of traditional challenge-based bot detection technologies.

**There are several versions of reCAPTCHA:**

- **reCAPTCHA v1**: The original version, which presented users with distorted text and asked them to type it into a box.
- **reCAPTCHA v2**: This version asks users to click on a checkbox confirming that they are not a robot. Sometimes it can also ask users to select specific types of images from a grid.
- **reCAPTCHA v3**: This version works in the background of websites to analyze user behavior and assign a score based on the perceived likelihood that the user is human or a bot. It's a more seamless experience for the user because it doesn't require any specific user interaction like previous versions.

In this blog, we will focus on solving reCAPTCHA v2,, the second version of Google's CAPTCHA, employs an "I am not a robot" checkbox or an invisible reCAPTCHA badge to discern genuine users from bots and looks like:

## So How reCAPTCHA v2 work
   
reCAPTCHA v2 operates by displaying either an "I am not a robot" checkbox or an invisible reCAPTCHA verification badge when a user engages with a secured website. Upon clicking the reCAPTCHA v2 checkbox, the system undertakes an automated identity verification process in the background. It promptly identifies and blocks any suspicious bot-like behavior to ensure user authenticity. So in many cases reCAPTCHA v2 is used to protect websites from unauthorised web scraping.

### How to solve reCAPTCHA v2?
If an issue with reCAPTCHA v2 has not been solved, you will potentially come across reCAPTCHA v2 on any web page, and this could prevent you from getting the data you want when conducting web scraping, so you must wonder how to solve reCAPTCHA v2 when we meet like if in web scraping? Here are some scenarios you can draw on

- Manual solving techniques: also commonly known as carefully selecting the desired image or solving the puzzle. However, this method requires a lot of interaction on your part, which is very time-consuming and inefficient.
- Use an automated solver: Automated solvers are services or application programming interfaces that provide solutions to reCAPTCHA v2 challenges. These services use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyse and solve challenges on behalf of users.
- Implement CAPTCHA solver libraries: Developers can integrate CAPTCHA solver libraries into their code to automate processes. These libraries provide functions and methods to interact with reCAPTCHA v2 and solve CAPTCHA challenges programmatically.
- Through Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques can be leveraged to train models capable of identifying and solving reCAPTCHA v2 challenges. By training models on large reCAPTCHA image datasets, they can learn to recognise patterns and solve challenges accurately.

### How to bypass reCAPTCHA v2?
When you're doing web scraping, you'll often get blocked by recaptcha v2, and it's a good idea to bypass that.

- Proxy Rotation: This can be done through the use of proxy pools, where users can rotate their IP addresses to avoid detection, but often requires high quality proxies.
- CAPTCHA Solution Services: Some services offer solutions that specifically bypass reCAPTCHA v2. These services use sophisticated algorithms and techniques to analyse and bypass the challenge, and one of the most recommended is [**Capsolver**](https://www.capsolver.com/products/recaptchav2), which is known for its speed, accuracy, variety, and affordability. I'll explain more about it below.
- Browser Automation Tools: Tools such as Selenium or Puppeteer can be used to automate web browsers and simulate human-computer interactions. By automating the entire browsing process, including solving the reCAPTCHA v2 challenge, these tools can bypass security measures.

### Step 3 : Creating a Task

To solve reCaptcha v2, you first need to create a task using the `createTask` method.

Here's the structure of the task object:

- `type`: Required. This should be `ReCaptchaV2Task` or `ReCaptchaV2TaskProxyLess`.
- `websiteURL`: Required. This is the web address of the website using reCaptcha v2.
- `websiteKey`: Required. This is the domain's public key.
- `proxy`: Optional. If you're using a proxy, you can include it here.
- `isInvisible`: Optional. If the reCaptcha doesn't have pageAction, set this to true.
- `userAgent`: Optional. If you're emulating a browser, include its User-Agent here.
- `cookies`: Optional. If you need to use cookies, include them here.

Here's an example request:

```json
{
  "clientKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "task": {
    "type": "ReCaptchaV2Task",
    "websiteURL": "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo",
    "websiteKey": "6Le-wvkSAAAAAPBMRTvw0Q4Muexq9bi0DJwx_mJ-",
    "isInvisible": false,
    "userAgent": "",
    "cookies": [
      {
        "name": "__Secure-3PSID",
        "value": "sdadasdasdsda"
      },
      {
        "name": "__Secure-3PAPISID",
        "value": "sd/AytXQTb6RUALqxSEL"
      }
    ],
    "proxy": ""
  }
}
```

Once the task is successfully submitted, you'll receive a Task ID in the response:

```json
{
  "errorId": 0,
  "errorCode": "",
  "errorDescription": "",
  "taskId": "61138bb6-19fb-11ec-a9c8-0242ac110006"
}
```
### Step 4 : Getting Results
Once you have the Task ID, you can use it to retrieve the solution. Submit the Task ID with the getTaskResult method. The results should be ready within an interval of 1s to 10s.

Here's an example request:
```json
{
  "clientKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "taskId": "61138bb6-19fb-11ec-a9c8-0242ac110006"
}
```
The response will include the solution token:

```json
{
  "errorId": 0,
  "errorCode": null,
  "errorDescription": null,
  "solution": {
    "userAgent": "xxx",
    "expireTime": 1671615324290,
    "gRecaptchaResponse": "3AHJ....." // This is the solution token
  },
  "status": "ready"
}
```

	//go get github.com/capsolver/capsolver-go
	//export CAPSOLVER_API_KEY='...' or
	//capSolver := CapSolver{ApiKey:"..."}

	capSolver := capsolver_go.CapSolver{}
	solution, err := capSolver.Solve(map[string]any{
		"type":       "ReCaptchaV2TaskProxyLess",
		"websiteURL": "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo",
		"websiteKey": "6Le-wvkSAAAAAPBMRTvw0Q4Muexq9bi0DJwx_mJ-",
